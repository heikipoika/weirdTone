# weirdTone
Project to understand the weird noise tone
Suddenly a weird tone started to sound out of my HiFi receiver and speaker setup.

Connecting a oscilloscope to the speaker input port revealed a strange static sine wave coming out of the receiver:

However, it can be seen that this tone is at **700 kHz** far beyond the maximum frequency that humans can hear.

Since this tone dominates the Oscilloscope, a FFT view is used to find the tone that can be heard.
